# P3. Final ERD
## Changes made to the initial ERD
Feedback from the TA:
> Your group did really well in P2. And there is nothing wrong in your ERD, so for your P3, please further develop your ERD based on your business requirements, think more about real life cases. For example, I saw your customer to review relationship is one to mandatory many, means one customer as least have one review, which is fine if you intended to design like this, but in real life, sometimes customer might not leave any reviews, thus, the relationship can be one to optional many. Also, is it possible for a customer to have more than one account? Or maybe one person is both a customer and an employee. You can think based on these and add more features to the database.
